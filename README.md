USAGE: The Piano synthesizer can be used to experiment with different sounds and effects. The sound is composed of two waveshapes which are both predefined as 'square' therefore creating a very cheesy sound. There are many waveshapes the user can choose and each of them will give a different taste to the sound; additionally, the user can choose to select two different waveshapes at the same time, combining their flavours and further exploring their sound set. If someone wants to create their own sound then they should choose 'Custom' and try out how the 5 values create a new personalised waveshape. Moreover, it is possible to experiment with effects that modify the current sound by ticking the box with the related label, such as distortion, which adds a grainy sound, or EQ, which filters frequencies the user might want to hide.
